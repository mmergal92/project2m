# Branding Database: Brand Kits -- Project 2

### The live site can be accessed here on Heroku: [Brand Kits](https://git-project-brand-kit.herokuapp.com/)

#### About this Project
For this project, I created an app that could be used by branding agencies. It would allow the branding agency to have a place to keep the brand kits of all their clients. As a strech feature, I would like to be able to have the clients (of the agency) log in and see their own brand kits. Ideally they can have access to edit and update only their brand kits. 

#### Technical Details 
I created an app with the 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD. Users can add, updated, delete, and view the brand kits. I have built a schema with required and default values for several key value pairs. I have also adhered to the MVC file structure. I added CSS to take in the values of the different brand colors and output them into a stylized show page. Originally, I created this app locally and used MongoDB to store my database. Afterwards, I deployed the app to Heroku and linked it to MongoDB Atlas to store my database in a global cloud so that it could be used.
